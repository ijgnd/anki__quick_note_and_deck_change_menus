This add-on has a very similar name and offers similar functionality to the popular add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1331140127" rel="nofollow">Quick note and deck buttons (Fork for 2.1)</a>. <b>Check out "Quick note and deck buttons" first</b>.




You can open a menu that presents some notetypes (or decks) with a shortcut, from the editor context menu or by right clicking the note type button (deck button) on top. This dialog opens next to your cursor so that you can quickly navigate through it. It's bigger so that you can more easily hit the right entry.

I made this add-on for me because "Quick note and deck buttons" doesn't work well for me on a small screen when I have multiple windows open so that the Add window is very narrow.

<b># Configuration</b>
You can configure this add-on in the usual way from the add-on manager. There are multiple options you can adjust. You can assign the menu entries hotkeys by prepending "&amp;" in front of a letter.

<b># Bug Reports</b>
Use it at your own risk. Please do not use reviews for bug reports or support requests. I don't get notified of your reviews, and properly troubleshooting an issue through them is nearly impossible. Instead, please either use the <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__quick_note_and_deck_change_menus" rel="nofollow">issue tracker (preferred)</a>
or just message me on reddit (/u/ijgnord).
