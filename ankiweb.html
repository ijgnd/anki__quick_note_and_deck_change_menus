This add-on has a very similar name and offers similar functionality to the popular add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1331140127" rel="nofollow">Quick note and deck buttons (Fork for 2.1)</a>. Check out the other add-on first.

I made this add-on for me because "Quick note and deck buttons" doesn't work well for me on a small screen when I have multiple windows open so that the Add window is very narrow.

<b># Configuration</b>
You can configure this add-on in the usual way from the add-on manager. There are multiple options you can adjust. You can assign the menu entries hotkeys by prepending "&amp;" in front of a letter.

<b># Bug Reports</b>
Use it at your own risk. Please do not use reviews for bug reports or support requests. I don't get notified of your reviews, and properly troubleshooting an issue through them is nearly impossible. Instead, please either use the <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__quick_note_and_deck_change_menus" rel="nofollow">issue tracker (preferred)</a>
or just message me on reddit (/u/ijgnord).
